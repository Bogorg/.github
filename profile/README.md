## Hi there 👋

### Welcome to **Bogorg**
The art of making things work in the weirdest possible way.  

We build strange, inefficient, and oddly satisfying solutions that somehow still work.  

Bogorg isn’t about nonsense for its own sake, it’s about **enjoying coding**.  
This is a space for people whose brains aren’t wired like everyone else’s,  
who love writing good code but using unconventional and creative techniques to do it.

### 🌀 Join the Org
Got a brilliantly bad idea? We want it.  

1. Think of something absurd that could somehow work.  
2. Actually make it work (barely).  
3. Click below and open an issue with the label **JOIN THE ORG**.  
   Write a short note about what you want to add or build.  

👉 [Join the Org](https://github.com/Bogorg/.github/issues/new?labels=JOIN%20THE%20ORG&title=I%20want%20to%20join%20bogorg&body=Write%20a%20short%20note%20about%20what%20you%20want%20to%20add!)

Built with questionable decisions, but at least we have fun.
